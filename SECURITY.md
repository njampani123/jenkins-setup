# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our Jenkins infrastructure seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Do Not** disclose the vulnerability publicly
2. Send details of the vulnerability to [INSERT SECURITY EMAIL]
3. Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Any suggested fixes (if known)

## Security Measures

Our Jenkins deployment implements several security best practices:

### Access Control
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for Kubernetes resources
- Matrix-based authorization strategy in Jenkins
- No public signup allowed
- Secure admin credentials management

### Network Security  
- Network policies restricting egress traffic
- TLS encryption for ingress traffic
- Jenkins master runs on private network
- JNLP port (50000) restricted to internal access

### Infrastructure Security
- Regular security updates and patches
- Resource limits to prevent DoS
- Persistent volume encryption
- Secrets management using Kubernetes secrets

### Application Security
- Security-focused plugins enabled
- CSRF protection
- Script security enabled
- Regular security scanning of build artifacts

## Secure Development

When contributing code:

1. Never commit sensitive data (credentials, tokens, etc.)
2. Follow secure coding practices
3. Keep dependencies up to date
4. Use approved plugins only
5. Test security controls before deployment

## Security Updates

We strive to address security vulnerabilities promptly:

- Critical: 24-48 hours
- High: 1 week
- Medium: 2 weeks
- Low: Next release cycle

Security patches will be released as soon as fixes are validated.

## Compliance

This deployment aims to follow security best practices from:

- CIS Benchmarks
- OWASP Security Guidelines
- Jenkins Security Advisory Guidelines
- Kubernetes Security Best Practices
